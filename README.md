### What is the Discord+ API?

Imagine having to write tens of thousands of lines of code to give your project low-to-mid level functionallity... Well, we've taken care of that for you! Now it's easier than ever to begin working directly with numerous databases, other apis, and much more!

Looking for the javadocs? 
Although they do not exist currently, we offer an incredible amount of documentation directly in our code. Granted, we will be adding docs for Discord+ shortly.
